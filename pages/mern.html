                For this project I worked with a team of five to implement a web app. The app consists of two parts, the customer end and the staff end. 
				The customer is able to search for a van nearby and then order food based on what's available. The staff member then recives their order and can prepare it before the customer arrives.
				The staff member can also stop displaying the van for customers when they are no longer serving with the click of a button. 
				My role on the team was to manage the database as well as the backend for the store itself. This was accomplished using mongo, mongoose, node js and a bit of handlebars.
