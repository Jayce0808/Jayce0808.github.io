				This was done in Unity and my main roles were the combat and the main menu UI.
				<br> <br>
				Scavenger Showdown is a multiplayer competitive collectathon party game for up to 4 players. 
				Whoever can find the objects scattered randomly around the map in a specific order wins. 
				This gameplay is enhanced with the addition of a combat system between players where you can send any rival back to the start, 
				losing them time. A singleplayer mode is also available, where players face the clock to achieve a low time.

				The customer is able to search for a van nearby and then order food based on what's available. The staff member then recives their order and can prepare it before the customer arrives.
				The staff member can also stop displaying the van for customers when they are no longer serving with the click of a button. 
				My role on the team was to manage the database as well as the backend for the store itself. This was accomplished using mongo, mongoose, node js and a bit of handlebars.
